## Counter hit additional Frame Advantage

| S | +06 |
| M | +13 |
| L | +08 |

## Neutral

- Stop throwing bad slashes
- Stop trying to fight out of the corner unless I have a plan.
  - Wait for a gap and jump out

## Dauro

- Don't grab after dauro hits, it will be in throw invincibility
- 5 and 6 frame moves will frametrap on hit
- 7 frame gets hit by grab
- High gravity dauro (e.g. 2K 2D Dauro) auto safe-jumps

### Counter hit

- 11 frames, so theoretically can close slash?

## Erarlumo

- Counterhit rekka 1 combos into dash cancel dauro into a high gravity combo.
- The gravity will make it so that dash cancel sword throw won't hit
  - 5k -> 6H -> Calvados
  - NEEDS LABBING -> 5k -> 214H -> Wait for splat maybe? -> Sabrobato
- Dash cancel is -19 on block, and -4 on hit.
- Erarlumo 2 will result in a 2F gap if Erarlumo 1 is blocked on the first frame.
- Floating crumple on ground hit: Total 28F (airborne 1~11F, standing 12~28F, can block 19~28F)

### Erarlumo 2

- Dash cancel is -17 [-15] on block, and -14 [KD] on hit.

## Sliding Daturo

- Connects after CH 5S/5H
- Combos with 2k Dauro
- PRC grab from this is probably just a cheese.

## Safe-jumps

- j.H/j.D has better rewards but late j.K is a really good mixup
  - Late j.K requires fd cancel for momentum to be safe
- Empty safe-jump into grab/2k are good mixups
- Throws guarantee a safe-jump
  - Air dash at the peak of the jump
  - Forward jump crosses up, use j.D late
  - Back jump does not
  - Auto-setup Frame kill with 5p iad

## 5D

- Uncharged dust is +0, not useful outside of Red RC
  - On hit, should use fast moves or block
- Gattlings from 2K, so condition for 2K 2D then 2K 5D RRC

## Jump cancels

- j.K should hit if really close on a forward JC
  - 5K -> 6j.K
  - c.S -> 6j.K
- j.K should combo into 214S
- JC BRC forwards is probably our best mix, probably dont need to early cancel it, esp if trying to trick them to block high

## Sword

- Plinking 3 keys/RC key is a nice way to really fast sword out
- fRC Sword can grab before sword comes out
- Combos off CH 6P
- Sword can meaty or setup in corner off HKD
  - Input when you see them start to get up
  - Might not be worth without them being in corner to lose sword
- PRC Sword Grab can have grab reach before sword and then sword meaty

## Positive bonus

- fRC can be really efficient

## Option Selects

- 4PS for left/right crossups
- 5H -> 214P 214K CH

## j.K

- Can F-Shiki with sword explosion

TODO: Watch replay against the Ram and check out their pressure

I need to stop cS 2Hing as it doesn't even frame trap.
6H frame traps while 2D would get the same reward.

## TODO: Map block string routes for every character

- Note where the transitions between commiting and not are
- Know the moves that can follow up with a high/low
- Note characters which can mixup or reset with special move (Fukyo, Teleports)

## Instant aerial

- backdash brc
  - what you want is actually to press dash then negative edge down while holding down back
    - this avoids the drift rc and keeps close
  - quarter circle back dash rc is ok
  - hold down back, press dash, let go of down.
    - buffer will make you backdash without drift, rc it
- jump aerial
  - can press rc and dash at same time as long as up is pressed and released before and direction is held after

## Dash cancel

- People can just look for orange and mash

---

## Mixups

- Backdash brc after 214k
  - j.214S can also hit rather than jK
- Sword toss PRC throw if fast enough gets a combo off the sword explosion on wall

c.S 2k dashup cS can only pick up sword if there is a throwable gap
can keep gapless with dashup cS but need 214p after to pick up sword

Remember to 2k 2d sword
