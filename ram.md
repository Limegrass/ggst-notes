## Counter hit additional Frame Advantage

| S | +06 |
| M | +13 |
| L | +08 |

## Neutral

- Stop throwing bad slashes
- Stop trying to fight out of the corner unless I have a plan.
  - Wait for a gap and jump out

## Dauro

- Don't grab after dauro hits, it will be in throw invincibility
- 5 and 6 frame moves will frametrap on hit
- 7 frame gets hit by grab
- High gravity dauro (e.g. 2K 2D Dauro) auto safe-jumps

### Counter hit

- 11 frames, so theoretically can close slash?

## Erarlumo

- Counterhit rekka 1 combos into dash cancel dauro into a high gravity combo.
- The gravity will make it so that dash cancel sword throw won't hit
  - 5k -> 6H -> Calvados
  - NEEDS LABBING -> 5k -> 214H -> Wait for splat maybe? -> Sabrobato
- Dash cancel is -19 on block, and -4 on hit.
- Erarlumo 2 will result in a 2F gap if Erarlumo 1 is blocked on the first frame.
- Floating crumple on ground hit: Total 28F (airborne 1~11F, standing 12~28F, can block 19~28F)

### Erarlumo 2

- Dash cancel is -17 [-15] on block, and -14 [KD] on hit.

## Sliding Daturo

- Connects after CH 5S/5H
- Combos with 2k Dauro
- PRC grab from this is probably just a cheese.

## Safe-jumps

- j.H/j.D has better rewards but late j.K is a really good mixup
  - Late j.K requires fd cancel for momentum to be safe
- Empty safe-jump into grab/2k are good mixups
- Throws guarantee a safe-jump
  - Air dash at the peak of the jump
  - Forward jump crosses up, use j.D late
  - Back jump does not
  - Auto-setup Frame kill with 5p iad

## 5D

- Uncharged dust is +0, not useful outside of Red RC
  - On hit, should use fast moves or block
- Gattlings from 2K, so condition for 2K 2D then 2K 5D RRC

## Jump cancels

- j.K should hit if really close on a forward JC
  - 5K -> 6j.K
  - c.S -> 6j.K
- j.K should combo into 214S
- JC BRC forwards is probably our best mix, probably dont need to early cancel it, esp if trying to trick them to block high

## Sword

- Plinking 3 keys/RC key is a nice way to really fast sword out
- fRC Sword can grab before sword comes out
- Combos off CH 6P
- Sword can meaty or setup in corner off HKD
  - Input when you see them start to get up
  - Might not be worth without them being in corner to lose sword
- PRC Sword Grab can have grab reach before sword and then sword meaty

## Positive bonus

- fRC can be really efficient

## Option Selects

- 4PS for left/right crossups
- 5H -> 214P 214K CH

## j.K

- Can F-Shiki with sword explosion

TODO: Watch replay against the Ram and check out their pressure

I need to stop cS 2Hing as it doesn't even frame trap.
6H frame traps while 2D would get the same reward.

## TODO: Map block string routes for every character

- Note where the transitions between commiting and not are
- Know the moves that can follow up with a high/low
- Note characters which can mixup or reset with special move (Fukyo, Teleports)

## Instant aerial

- backdash brc
  - what you want is actually to press dash then negative edge down while holding down back
    - this avoids the drift rc and keeps close
  - quarter circle back dash rc is ok
  - hold down back, press dash, let go of down.
    - buffer will make you backdash without drift, rc it
- jump aerial
  - can press rc and dash at same time as long as up is pressed and released before and direction is held after

## Dash cancel

- People can just look for orange and mash

---

## Mixups

- Backdash brc after 214k
  - j.214S can also hit rather than jK
- Sword toss PRC throw if fast enough gets a combo off the sword explosion on wall

c.S 2k dashup cS can only pick up sword if there is a throwable gap
can keep gapless with dashup cS but need 214p after to pick up sword

---

Remember to 2k 2d sword

Two steps after grab is the iad safe jump timing. (5p frame kill is the auto setup, but for crossup)
or right after seeing the yellow sparks on ground
1.5 steps neutral jump after 2D -> jH safejump
Can cross up with jD

Probably try to jump right after IB attempt, or tech grab if doing fuzzies

Main thing is probably commiting to a mash if I mash
Also to combo into dauro pretty much always after first hit if possible
eg. after cH jS
Kara is super good for meter building in general

Would be good to mix in some fake stuff to increase mental stack
Don't overcomplicate if the opponent is stupid, frame traps should be enough

Cancel jH into jD j.214S

2k and 2s gets much better combos if you can combo into dauro

CH fS into dauro should not over-rekka initially
using WA to combo to the wall can save me the meter to wallbreak

max fS range dauro does not combo into 5k/2k

make sure to cancel every air move into 214S on hit

j.214K is plus so press something after
Since it is a high, the plus frames is mostly dependent on how high you are when you start the move. No crouch blocks.
Rare instances where it can be more plus if they dash block into it or the tiny forward movement catches them in block later, or they stand into it from a crouch
Chest height can frametrap a grab (only grabbable with IB) and below can be true blockstring with 5p

iad jS after 214H is a frametrap/safejump only from cS 2H 214h

---

cS 2H dauro 5k rekka1x4 dc 236s cS 2H 214h builds enough meter for wallbreak wall to wall

Probably at least +3 after jH as I can 5k catch a jump often

---

6h after 214h frrc (or even if rrc doesnt hit)

---

Can meaty sword against wall if fuck up rekka cancels into rekka3 uncharged
midscreen can runup fS wa for pressure

likely can S sword for cross up obviously

---

~~rekka3 hkd -> whiff 5k hj iad FDC jK +5 (depends on how high jK hits)~~
might not need hj just need to time the jK a little late
rekka3 hkd -> whiff 5k iad FDC jK +5~+8 (depends on how high jK hits)

---

rekka2 HKD -> HJ jH meaty (not safejump) +1~+6

---

brc bd -> cS 2H rekka1 dc 214h to keep swords
otherwise cS 2H rekka1 rekka1 236s 5k cS 2H 214k 214h

---

cH 5k 5k dauro 2k 214p 66 236S 5k dash after recovery cS 2H 214p 214h 214h wall to wall break

have to confirm the second 5k fast else first 214p whiffs

---

no sword spend/mid screen
fS dauro cS 2H 214p 5k 6H 214k/214h (if round start distance)

wall to wall must spend WA + WA OR s sword to wall break. neither are burst safe
fS dauro cS 2H 236[D] 2H 214p dc 236s

first rekka1 into 214h is somewhat consistent

---

Rock on oki vs Baiken

BRC makes grab frame 3 instead of 2

TODO: learn how many frames required to do each safe jump

2k 2D WA is a combo starter

---

5k dauro 5k j214S delay iad jD
can crossup depending on walk direction
manually timed safe jump
timing depends on height of j214S

also crossup can depend on jump direction during 214s

can get 5k dauro 5k jK j214S
makes it a little easier to time the safe jump it feels

FDC jK safe jump too ofc probably better but even more execution

---

5k 6p dauro -> safe jump +3~8
2k 6p dauro -> no safejump, safe jab with rock +9
