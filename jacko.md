I should mix in 5h pull and cS pull

also cS grab at least once a set

^ does not work in S3 actually

Probably works in corner too, need to test? Might be harder due to hitting minion cancelling hitstop

Assuming you have a minion out:
2K 2D 214K > 2K 2D 214K > c.S f.S 5H
Add delays between 2D 214K and 214K 2K for frame traps. Go for throws every now and then when they've shown they're respecting your frame traps. Can omit one of the 2K strings if you're low on resources. Not the best pressure string since you burn through resources quickly but it's easy to remember.

2K 2D 214K > c.S&(hit) > c.S 2H 214K > 2P&(hit)/5K&(hit) > md c.S f.S 5H
Add delays between 214K > c.S& or anywhere after the second c.S wherever you want to frame trap. c.S&(hit) is whenever you make them block a c.S and you hit a minion between you and them. This makes your c.S on block go from +1 to +6. This allows you to create an auto-timed frame trap with a second c.S that can catch people trying to jump, mash, attempt to tech a throw, etc.
You can replace the c.S& with a 2P&. 2P& is +9 and allows you to keep the string gapless; good if you're trying to pressure against a DP spammer for example.
5K&(hit) is +6 and is an easy way to enforce plus frames to continue pressure.

Her strings without a minion or resources are very limited. The best you can do usually is end a string with 5H > 214P or 236[P].
5H > 214P makes you -1 instead of -6 and the pushback from 5H puts you at very safe spacing allowing you to end pressure safely and/or try to steal a turn back.
5H > 236[P] is +4 and leaves you with a minion in hand but remember you cannot block while holding a minion so you'll want to think ahead.

---

don't autopilot 5h when minion behind too much

---

after 2h/6h ender, minion pull micro dash 9 throw j.S

- safe jump
- also +7 if just blocked

---

TK attack command

---

5h back hit into minion pull is positive (must pull minion)
no cancel will end up more negative than normal
positive enough to just place minion fully often

---

2k 2d rrc combo

tempest vs nitro
game 3 round 1

you need to microdash for exactly 2 frames otherwise this doesnt work,
with 1 frame having the jp whiff and 3frames causing a crossup instead due to too much momentum

must cancel the jp frame 1 otherwise the 214k doens't connect

---

must jp after 2d knockdown for safe jump same side
doesnt seem like cross up is a safe jump

---

If they don't bite on frame traps, then take more turns with normals without finishing
don't 2d or pull

---

could probably OS the super prc

hcb forward back p~k dash rc

most success seems to be just with supering and then waiting on timing prc with wakeup

---

Watch self for wakeup 6pk os
Watch self for wakeup FD

---

!IMPORTANT figure out how much frame ad is needed for each safe jump

---

dash cancel brc into any move place minion is still super plus (+7~18)
5h is highest attack level/shortest startup to maximize brc frames
cS could probably fshiki

dash fBRC cS/236p does not give advantage, -5 cS

---

cS 2S& 5h is +14, needs dash momentum for 2S to put them in blockstun to be gapless

8f gap otherwise
idr how this worked?? when can I 2S? need to go back to nidaime's streams to study

---

5H 236p walk/dash (lenient) forwards throw minion iad 236k can be super plus (+10~19 if minion hits, if only kick hits, +5)

not safe but can be scary to contest with clap threat

---

2d frc place minion is actually -2

---

2d OTG (cS 236k 214k) 5h 236p to place minion

For those without invincible reversals

---

With a minion in front of them, can maybe 2D kick (check frames?)

- 5k& minion meaty iad jH can be a cross up

---

2S minion might generally be unsafe, but if you can sneak it in before 5h, it'll give a lot of frame advantage whne it lands

jH&whiff 66 jH will be gapless if no gap is left between inputs
6pable otherwise

jS can replace it instead and will hit 6p
jS is already super +

Do it fairly low to the ground to be more plus (can more than +18 even)

---

fS to hit minion into better angle just 5k and just pull minion after for more situations

---

one setup for minion drop jP other than FED

TODO: learn how many frames required to do each safe jump

---

frrc from level 4 -> +~2/3
frrc from level 3 -> ~-2

fprc can be basically gapless.
one attempt had a frametrap 2k
regardless, also applies slow so it's probabyl generally better
minion in position to 5h

will beat 5frames even if +0 because of prc slow
can beat throws if timed really well because of the slow too

most timings will beat throw because of spacing anyways even if not plus enough for it

getting a fbrc is probably even better
both fprc and fbrc will beat other 5fs even at +0 due to slow
the slow makes 5 framers into 9 framers (2x the 4 frame startup to 8)

can't seem to do from level 2 (e.g. 2D) if they hard mash
3 and 4 is good, but needs to be kind of clean inputs for 3

---

62 frames for perfectly inputted hj iad jp safejump, 2 active frames.

super is +59

Doing it too perfect will have the active frames not be ready during the actual wakeup
64f for pull throw minion jS safejump at fastest, 5 active
5 active for jH too

manually timed, can get iad jS/jH on super
also can crossup

jP safejump is good after the cS 2H 214k 5k dc cS 6H combo
the difference between the two isn't really the frame requirements I think? Mostly the distance need to travel
If not enough spare frames, the run up momentum needed for jS/jH might take too long

Particularly for 2H enders -> further, jP might be generally better?
