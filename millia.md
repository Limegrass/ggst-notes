Fuzzy jump

So, millia disc depends on the move she knocks you down with.

If she hits her sweep, no getting out. Time to guess.

But her throw and haircar are both too delayed to get proper oki, you can always jump out of it or 6p. She can block your attacks while falling though, and the disc will stay out, so that's where the mindgames come in.

If you think she will go airdash mix, jump. If you think she'll hit you out of a jump, 6p. if she is just going to fall and block your 6p, either jump, or simply block.

You gotta kinda time your jumps though, and there a few other asterisks in there with spacing and timing, and I didn't even mention backdash, but there IS counterplay. Just avoid her sweep at all costs. That's pure guess city.

jH after throw disc is a safejump, so trying to jump out or trying to 6P will get you hit by a meaty jH, unless they try to do the normal meaty disc oki on the delayed disc.

You will have to block and then fuzzy jump.
