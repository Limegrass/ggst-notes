2s will probably often lead to dandy p (crossup) k (no crossup)

fuzzy jump vs dandy
jump after pilebunker timing
high hit dandy is the only one with advantage vs jump

master's hammer and low whiffs, pilebunker is punishable on block

if they adapt and only do high, then can start jabbing it

baiting k mappa in the range where it is -2 is a good way to take turn
