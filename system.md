## Dash

- Dash past jumps/IADs can be good and can cross up

## Landing recovery

After landing from an empty jump:

1~6F cannot do any movement options except backdash
7F onwards all actions possible

After performing an action in the air (air jumping, air dashing, any air attack without specified landing recovery):

1~3F after landing is normal recovery (cannot do any action such as blocking, attacking, moving etc...)
4F onwards all actions possible

Airblock strikes induces blockstun until landing and 19f of grounded block stun if you land after blocking unless you IB, then it's 5f
Might even be 0 now? Uncertain but seems like 0 based off frame viewer
Airblock projects is 5f
Airblock causes 50% more risc

prc and brc is 6f
rrc is 1f and +24 on block
This is why timing for FRC differs
YRC is 14f, -16 on block, +10

Gold burst is 18f, -2
Blue is 14f like YRC, -18
