# Nago

Beyblade -> Fukyo

- Grab safe or no
- -3 Beyblade, so if they don't do anything then it is grabbable
  - 5p doesn't reach jumps I think, 2p definitely doesn't
- Does FD put them out of grab range?

If they spam fast normals like 5p, jump out?
Up back is probably safer than backdashing on a fukyo reaction

Nago super jump is 10f

Backdash bloodrage, the hitbox is tiny.

## Round Start
- Rotate between jump back and back dash
- Back dash can be caught by a beyblade gamble

## Wakeup
- Don't mash or backdash. Block or jump
- Bite, clone, and c.S + PRCs makes the risk rewards super good.

## Fukyo
- Try to react to the timing of the faster back fukyo to punish
- Don't wait for forward fukyo to reappear
- Back jump is probably safest against fukyo rather than trying to punish
- BRC forwards if they fukyo you blocking to help react

## Beyblade
- Grab punishable (-3)
- If they special cancel (fukyo, DP), grabs will miss/get counter hit
- Switch to blocking high after for DP/walking away so they miss grab
- They can't actually special cancel past a certain point in it.
    - This is when Nago has his back to the screen in the beyblade animation

## Clone
- Clone fukyo (~1.3 bar) leads to bite RPS
- Jump this if you can

## f.SS
- FD is enough to make bite miss unless they walk forwards? Is this still true

## f.SSS
- Recovers blood but -25

## Bloodrage
- Backdash it after flash, the hitbox is tiny (next to him only)
- Don't milk the drain during the pop
    - Damage as soon as the pop happens so guts don't come in
- Do a long combo so drain takes full effect
