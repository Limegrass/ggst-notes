j.S spam is 13f gaps
Hover dash is actionable only on f10
Airborne on f5
jump is 4f. still
that means 18f to jS?

After landing from an empty jump:

1~6F cannot do any movement options except backdash
7F onwards all actions possible

After performing an action in the air (air jumping, air dashing, any air attack without specified landing recovery):

1~3F after landing is normal recovery (cannot do any action such as blocking, attacking, moving etc...)
4F onwards all actions possible

Always better to perform a move it seems?
